                Founded in 1995, Edirisinghe Cushion Works began as a small family business with a passion for
                craftsmanship and an eye for detail. What started as a modest workshop has grown into a leading name in
                vehicle interior customization across Sri Lanka.

              <p>
                Our founder, Mr. Edirisinghe, believed that every vehicle deserves an interior that reflects its owner's
                personality and enhances their driving experience. This philosophy continues to guide our work today, as
                we combine traditional craftsmanship with modern techniques to create interiors that exceed
                expectations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the years, we have expanded our services and expertise, but our commitment to quality and customer
                satisfaction remains unchanged. Every project we undertake is approached with the same dedication to
                excellence that has defined our company for over two decades.
